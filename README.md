# HomeAssistant_RecurringTaskWithReminder
Sends a recurring notification at a user-defined time and date. When triggered, a task is added to a selected to-do list, and a notification is sent to the user. The notification includes an action to mark the task as done, which removes the to-do item. If not removed, reminders are sent at the chosen interval until the task is done.
